Siddhi operator divides the given Siddhi app into two partial Siddhi apps and deploys both apps in two kubernetes deployments. Those two apps are,

1. Passthrough app (power-consume-app-0)
1. Process app  (power-consume-app-1)

Passthrough app receives HTTP requests and redirects those requests to the NATS streaming cluster. Process app receives events from NATS, execute the logic, and logs the output.

Since Passthrough app contains an HTTP source, Siddhi operator by default creates a kubernetes service for the deployment and expose the HTTP endpoint through an ingress. Minikube uses the minikube IP as the ingress external IP. Siddhi operator uses hostname called `siddhi` to receive all external traffic. Therefore we need to add the `siddhi` entry to the `/etc/hosts` file like below.

``` echo " `minikube ip` siddhi" >> /etc/hosts ```{{execute}}

Before sending any request we need to ensure that all pods are up and running.

`kubectl get pods`{{execute}}

```sh
$ kubectl get pods

```

Send an event using an HTTP request. You can send multiple HTTP requests. The Siddhi app will print the log in every 30 seconds if the total power you send is greater than or equal to 10000W.

```
    curl -X POST \
    http://siddhi/power-consume-app-0/8080/checkPower \
    -H 'Accept: */*' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Host: siddhi' \
    -d '{
    "deviceType": "dryer",
    "power": 100000
    }'
```{{execute}}

Use the following command to view logs. Logs will print in every 30 seconds.

`kubectl logs $(kubectl get pods | awk '{ print $1 }' | grep ^power-consume-app-1) | tail -n 2`{{execute}}
